# TMDBMovies

## How to build :

### Since it's a small test project I decided to not use any 3rd party library.
In production app I would rather use Kingfisher for instance for downloading and caching 
image. But for this small task just pull and run =)

## Architecture decision

### Using MVVM

## Assumptions

### Since the test demands using SwiftData or Coredata, the details and favorite views
dont make use of a API Request. Just first screen for Top Rated and Most Popular movies

## Difficulties Faced 
The use of SwiftData to use the data locally for building pages instead of a regular API call.
Besides its the first time I use SwiftData, which may have contain some "code smell" on it.
