# TMDBMovies

## How to build :

### Project not using any 3rd party library, simple just pull and run =)

## Architecture decision

### Using MVVM

## Assumptions

### Since the test demands using SwiftData or Coredata, the details and favorite views
### dont make use of a API Request. Just first screen for Top Rated and Most Popular movies

## Difficulties Faced 
### The use of SwiftData to use the data locally for building pages instead of a regular API call.
### Besides its the first time I use SwiftData, which may have contain some "code smell" on it.
